# Manga-to-Text Plot Extraction System Design

## Overview

The Manga-to-Text Plot Extraction System transforms static manga pages into structured text-based narratives while preserving essential character art style context. The system analyzes multiple manga pages to extract dialogue, narrative elements, character descriptions, and visual storytelling components, then synthesizes them into coherent plot summaries with character art style references.

### Core Value Proposition

- Extract coherent storylines from sequential manga pages
- Preserve character visual identity and art style context
- Generate structured plot summaries suitable for further processing
- Maintain narrative flow and character relationships across pages

### Key Capabilities

- Multi-page manga analysis and content extraction
- Character identification and art style documentation
- Dialogue extraction and speaker attribution
- Scene context understanding and narrative flow construction
- Plot synthesis with visual style preservation

## Component Architecture

### 1. Page Preprocessing Module

**Purpose:** Prepare manga pages for analysis by standardizing format and quality

**Responsibilities:**

- Image quality enhancement and noise reduction
- Page orientation detection and correction
- Resolution normalization for consistent processing
- Format standardization across different manga sources

**Input Processing:**

- Accepts various image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- Handles different page orientations and sizes
- Supports both color and black-and-white manga
- Manages multi-page batch processing

### 2. Panel Extraction Engine

**Purpose:** Identify and extract individual panels from manga pages in correct reading order

**Panel Detection Strategy:**

- Contour-based boundary detection using computer vision
- Reading order determination (right-to-left for Japanese, left-to-right for Western)
- Panel relationship mapping for narrative flow
- Irregular panel shape handling

**Panel Classification:**

- Action panels (movement, combat, dynamic scenes)
- Dialogue panels (character conversations)
- Establishing shots (scene setting, location introduction)
- Close-up panels (emotional moments, reactions)
- Transition panels (scene changes, time passage)

### 3. Content Analysis Engine

**Multi-Modal Analysis Components:**

#### Text Extraction Module

- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for dialogue and text
- Speech bubble detection and text isolation

### 4. Character Style Repository

**Purpose:** Maintain consistent character art style documentation across the narrative

**Character Profile Structure:**

- Visual characteristics (hair style, clothing, distinctive features)
- Art style elements (line weight, shading style, proportions)
- Expression patterns and emotional range
- Pose and gesture tendencies
- Color palette associations

**Style Consistency Tracking:**

- Character appearance evolution across pages
- Art style variation documentation
- Key visual identifiers for each character
- Reference image compilation for style context

### 5. Plot Synthesis Engine

**Purpose:** Combine extracted elements into coherent text-based narratives

**Narrative Construction Process:**

- Chronological event ordering across multiple pages
- Character dialogue integration with speaker attribution
- Scene description synthesis from visual analysis
- Action sequence translation to text narrative
- Emotional arc identification and documentation

**Plot Structure Generation:**

- Scene-by-scene breakdown with character involvement
- Dialogue passages with character style context
- Action descriptions informed by visual analysis
- Character development notes with art style evolution
- Narrative flow with visual storytelling elements
